 Roadmap.
 Introduction
 Multiple organisations -including the World Economic Forum -have published research
 predicting the rise of blockchain adoption and its role as an emerging technology disrupting
 major industries worldwide. In particular, Moody's Investors Servicel has identified financial
 institutions as having 7 of the top 25 blockchain use cases including trade finance, peer-to-
 peer transactions and international payments.
 Since the beginning of 2017, cryptocurrencies and tokens have grown from 771 to 1,104
 (+43%)2 and their market cap has spiked from $16 billion to $143 billion driven by an
 increase in institutional and retail investors. Exchanges have seen their combined volumes
 (and consequently profits) increase rapidly to $8 billion on 18tAugust 2017. Such growth in
 capital inflow, diversification across multiple cryptos and retail investors'interest create
 demand for a crypto to crypto exchange that is not only fast and private, but also easy-to-
 use and visually appealing.
 While merchants are adopting payments in cryptocurrencies they are mostly confined to
 accepting Bitcoin thus limiting their ability to seize the increasing user base of other cryptos,
 now worth more than $60 billion combined. This fast developing space is where Flyp.me's
 mission and value proposition play a significant role through its permissionless API for multi-
 currency payments, profit sharing and participatory policy-making, including proposing and
 voting for new features.
 The team
 Flyp. me is the brainchild of the current team at HolyTransaction, the first web wallet to
 support Ethereum, one of the first multi-currency wallets and the oldest still active.Holy
T
 Transaction has experienced growth of +,000% in the first 6 months of 2017.
 Francesco Simonetti, CEO of Flyp. me and Holy Transaction, has been active in the crypto
 community since 2013 after founding the Bitcoin meet up in Rome. He is a founding
 member of the Blockchain Education Network ltalia-a non-profit organization born to
 promote the growth and diffusion of blockchain technology -co-founder of the Bitcoin
 Foundation Italia and of Assobit.
 Currently, 6 professionals from different backgrounds work at Flyp me full-time and others
 are contracted part-time, when and if needed. Considering the nature of our business, we
 don't deem it safe to publish the full list of team members, because this can expose them to
 the risk of personal attacks and possible corruption from external actors.

 Current issues with exchanges
 All but one exchange require different tiers of personal information to be able to trade-
 including email, full name, passport picture and proof of address. Revealing this information
 greatly decreases the privacy of users and exposes them to risks such as targeted crime,
 fraud and identity theft.
 Additionally, the majority of exchanges require crypto to be deposited in the exchange's
 account before the user can perform a transaction. This slows down the process for the user.
 Exchanges share several downsides including but not limited to:
 Technical barriers
 Rates
 Privacy
 Degraded service
 Security of funds
 Limited number of
 trading pairs
 Figure 1: Current issues
 Technical barriers
 Most exchanges require a medium to high level of technical knowledge and understanding
 of exchange dynamics and are not being designed to cater to the growing number of entry-
 level users.
 Privacy
 While some exchanges claim to respect users'privacy by not requesting any information that
 is unnecessary, they obtain information about users through other means-including web
 analytics, customer service software, marketing automation platforms and email marketing
 services. This is often called identity inference through digital fingerprinting.
 Through these means data is willingly stored and shared with third parties:
 Users' location information including IP address GPS and other sensors that may, for
 example, allow the service provider to access information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi
 access points and mobile towers.
 Users'operating system, browser ID, browsing activity, and other information about
 how they interacted with the exchange or with other websites.
 The language they speak, which ads they'll find most useful, the people who matter
 most to them online and which YouTube videos they might like.
 Those services might also be able to link users' transactions to their name, email
 address, telephone number or credit card.
 Device-specific information such as hardware model, operating system version,
 unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
 Log information including details of how they used their service, such as search
 queries, telephony log information, calling-party number, forwarding numbers,time
 and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls,
 cookies that may uniquely identify their browser or the user activity on the web,
 including their ads_ids and other unique identifiers.
 Security of funds
 Funds need to be deposited in the exchanges account address prior to the user being able
 to trade. This means more time is needed to perform an exchange due to the waiting time
 for deposits. Also, the users funds are at greater risk because they are held by an exchange
 which controls the users private keys.
 Limited number of trading pairs
 Tradable crypto pairs are limited to the ones offered by each exchange. Depending on which
 pair a user wants to trade, it is necessary to use a different exchange which requires longer
 to either set up or access as opposed to using a single service.

 Privacy risks of web payments via cryptocurrencies https: //arxiv. org/pdf/1708.04748.pdf
 Degraded service
 Partial or complete outages frequently affect exchanges, individually and simultaneous.
 Often, the resulting degraded services, affect several user types including API and website
 users.
 Rates
 Trading pair rates and withdrawal fees differ greatly from exchange to exchange resulting in
 a lack of choice for users unless they have accounts on multiple exchanges.
 Flyp. me exchange overview
 Flyp. me is the fastest and most private crypto-to-crypto exchange which doesn't require any
 registration. The only information needed to use the exchange is the users crypto address
 so that Flyp me has the correct input and output to perform and finalize the transaction.
 Only minimal trust is needed since Flyp. me doesn't hold users' funds nor the private keys.
 Flyp.me sends the amount exchanged back to the user as soon as the user's transaction is
 confirmed on the blockchain. This is because Flyp me keeps its own reserve funds for each
 cryptocurrency and token supported which enable the exchange to happen instantly.
 Flyp. mes competitive exchange rates are determined the moment the deposit is sent, unlike
 other exchanges. This guarantees users get the precise amount of cryptocurrencies and
 tokens they have requested at the exact time they send the order. The exchange rates
 applied are based on the average rates of other exchanges, market depth of the chosen pair
 and reserve funds.

 Flyp me business model
 The exchange of cryptocurrencies and tokens is one of only a few business models in the
 crypto space that makes a consistent and reliable profit, regardless of the pricing or
 performance of any specific crypto and token in the market.
 Over the last few months this space has seen increasing interest with record level of users
 and trading volumes, which greatly impacted the performance of all exchanges due to
 complete or partial outages. Considering the recent levels of volatility in the crypto market,
 slow or unresponsive exchanges can have devastating consequences for traders. Moreover,
 the growing nur
 number of entry-level users acquiring crypto is in need of exchange services
 which don'trequire a medium to high level of technical knowledge.
 Flyp.me solves these and other problems by providing an exchange service that is easy-to-
 use and visually appealing while leveraging a number of other exchanges to perform
 transactions and secure the best rates for different trading pairs. Exchanges via Flyp me are
 so fast because Flyp me keeps its own reserve funds for each cryptocurrency and token
 supported which enable the exchange to happen instantly.
 Flyp.mes revenue is driven by exchange rates charged on Flyp.me and through the strategic
 partners that are integrating the Flyp me APl to accept multi-currency payments.
 Current exchange rates, while being competitive, are not final. They will be decided
 following the ICO and voted by FYP Token owners to find an optimum balance between
 driving the adoption of Flypme and maximizing the generation of profits.
 Flyp.me operates in the accountless exchange industry which currently sees an average of
 E250 million traded monthly. This is set to increase exponentially as the market matures.

 Flyp. me benefits and features
 In line with its mission of becoming the leading accountless exchange, Flyp. me has built-in
 profit sharing mechanisms, adoption-based rewards, a permissionless APl and participatory
 policy-making including proposing and voting for new features. Available immediately, the
 exchange can be accessed on the Flyp me website.
 Flyp. me is built on six main pillars:
 . Accountless experience
 Uncompromised privacy
 Fastest speed
 Profit sharing
 Participatory policy-making
 Transparency and accountability
 Permissionless API
 Accountless experience
 Flyp.me doesn't require any registration, email or identity verification, doesnt store users'IP
 address and doesn't track their activities in any way. Flyp me doesn't hold users'funds
 beyond the time of the transaction being executed.
 Uncompromised privacy
 Flyp.me doesn't request and doesn't obtain information about users including through
 means such as web analytics, customer service software, marketing automation platforms
 and email marketing services. Unlike other exchanges, Flyp. me will not give away data
 voluntarily to any third party.
 Private by design, Flyp me stores input and output address of every exchange and the
 amount changed. After the ICO, Flyp. me will anonymize these logs on a periodical basis, in
 accordance with applicable regulations. This is part of Flyp.me's"data minimisation
â€�
 strategy.
 To detect if the servers are under attack for any reason, Flyp me keeps user agent,IP,access
 URL and referrer URL. These logs are purged on a weekly basis.
 Fastest speed
 Flyp. me is committed to delivering the fastest crypt-to-crypto exchange while providing an
 easy-to-use service which removes all technical barriers. Flyp me performs and finalizes
 exchanges as fast as the time it takes for the cryptocurrency chosen to confirm safely on the
 blockchain.
 Flyp.me has reduced to the minimum the number of clicks required to perform transactions
 and removed unnecessary Javascript animations to ensure the site's performance is at its
 highest.
8
 Profit sharing
 A system has been designed to distribute 50% of profits from the fees generated by the
 exchange referred as the payout.
 Every three months, the profits will be distributed to FYP Token owners in proportion to
 their ownership of Tokens. The payout will be sent in ETH by default. However, Token owners
 will be able to request payouts in other cryptos supported by Flyp. me.
 Following the first two payouts, the timing of the payout will be voted by the Token owners
 in line with Flyp mes commitment to participatory policy-making.
 All costs incurred in the running of Flyp me will be covered by the funds raised during the
 Presale and ICo. Therefore, until Presale and ICo funds have been used, the profits will be
 equal to the revenue. Please read"Use of funds" section for more details.
 Following the end of the ICO, Token ownership will be freely transferable on the market.
 Participatory policy-making
 Participatory policy making is an approach to the overall goal of facilitating the inclusion of
 individuals or groups in the design of policies via consultative or participatory means to
 achieve accountability, transparency and active membership.
 The FYP Token grants entitles its owner to propose and vote for key decisions. Each and
 every FYP Token is divisible, equal to each other and has exactly the same qualities and
 properties. Following the ICO, no additional FYP Tokens will be created.
 Proposing will incur a"symbolic"FYP pledge which will subsequently be redistributed to the
 users of the exchange. There will be a set time frame to upvote any given proposal following
 which the most upvoted proposals will be evaluated by the Flyp me team before
 commencing a formal voting phase.
 The number of votes held is proportional to the number of FYP Tokens owned. Any FYP
 owner can vote for additional cryptocurrencies and tokens, features and decisions.
 Transparency and accountability
 Flyp. me will publicly disclose aggregated costs and allow FYP Token owners with more than
 200,000 FYP to audit costs, volumes and related information to certify them for the wider
 community. In the eventuality that no FYP Token owner requests to perform an audit,
 Flyp. me will use the services of an independent auditor yearly.
 Permissionless ApI
 Flyp. me has built a permissionless APl to enable businesses and developers anywhere to
 integrate Flyp. me with services such as e-commerce sites, multicurrency wallets, brick and
 mortar points of sale, crypto startups at ICO stage and crypto-specific media.
 The Flyp me team believes in the freedom to explore new technologies without seeking
 prior approval and by providing a permissionless APl allows not only faster implementation
 but also experimentation and permissionless innovation.
 Following the ICO, the team will implement modules for popular coding languages to enable
 developers to build applications using the programming language of their choice.
 Innovations
 Flyp. me aims to promote innovation within the crypto space and will prioritize R&D in the
 latest technology improvements with a focus on decentralized asset platforms, 2nd layer
 solutions for cryptocurrency networks to allow transactions to be securely routed across
 multiple peer-to-peer networks and atomic exchanges. These improvements will ultimately
 increase efficiencies and cut costs.
 The Flyp me team also believes that through the promotion of innovation, the Flyp.me
 community will become stronger and more committed. This will also help the growth of the
 user base and drive an increase in the exchanged volumes while enabling new interesting
 models of interaction and platform governance
 Decentralized asset platforms
 Flyp. me will integrate decentralized asset platforms in order to provide an even higher level
 of privacy for users and downsize the reserve funds needed to run Flypme in its current
 form. Additionally, as the hosting of decentralized exchanges is distributed through nodes,
 there is no risk of server downtime.
 2nd layer solutions
 Flyp.me will adopt 2nd layer solutions which enable instant off-chain transfer of the
 ownership of different cryptocurrencies and tokens, without the need of a trusted third
 party. These systems utilize bidirectional payment channels consisting of multi-signature
 addresses.
 The priority will be the implementation of the Lightning Network for sending and receiving
 funds for the exchanges performed on Flyp me so that they will be instant, without the need
 to wait for confirmations.
 Atomic exchanges
 Flyp.me will research and develop atomic exchanges in order to reduce costs and enable
 decentralized cross-chain trading.
 Cryptographic auditing
 Flyp. me envisage implementing state of the art cryptographic auditing methods to provide
 maximum transparency and accountability. These include proof of reserves, volumes and
 profits+to avoid any potentially fraudulent activity.

 Adoption-based rewards
 To reward active membership and increase adoption of Flyp. me, the FYP Tokens pledged to
 propose changes to Flyp. me and a percentage of FYP Tokens owned by Flypme willbe
 distributed to exchange users.
 FYP tokens distribution
 The Flyp me Token(FYP) is an ERC-20 token and its initial distribution will be in the form of a
 Presale and an ICO. In the process, Flyp. me will create a number of FYP Tokens according to
 the contributions made during the Presale and ICO and the ratio applied for the creation of
 FYP Tokens. Contributions to the Presale and ICO are accepted in BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE,
 DASH, FAIR, GAME, DCR, ZEC, SYS, PPC, BLK, GRC.
 FYP Tokens will be distributed at the end of the ICO. No additional FYP Tokens will be created
 after the end of the ICO.
 Presale Phase I: 10th July 2017(15.00 UTC), +21%bonus, 1ETH=4840FYP
 Presale Phase ll: 21st July 2017(15.00 UTC), +15%bonus, 1 ETH =4600 FYP
 Presale Phase lll: 6th September 2017(15.00 UTC), +12.5%bonus, 1ETH=4500 FYP

 +5% bonus before Hidden-Hard-Cap, 1ETH=4200 FYP
 ICOends
 21st October 2017(15.00 UTC)
 If Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached, the ICO will end 3(three)hours after the Hidden-Hard-Cap
 threshold is reached. The exact time for beginning and closing of the Ico period, as for the
 time of the countdown closing, will be determined in blocks' numbers of the Ethereum
 Blockchain. The exact block number for start and end of the ICo will be communicated
 before the ICo commences. The three-hour countdown when the Hidden-Hard-Cap is
 reached is counted in 700 blocks.
 The Soft-Cap will be disclosed as the iCo goes live. The Hidden-Hard-Cap will be revealed as
 soon as it will be reached and will trigger the 3(three)hours countdown that will definitely
 end the ICO. Flyp. me will publish a hash of the Hard-Cap, so that anyone can check the Hard-
 Cap hasn't been changed.
 The percentage of FYP Tokens assigned to Flyp me itself is variable depending on whether
 the Soft-Cap and Hidden-Hard-Cap are reached by the end of the ICO (as detailed below).
11
 If the Soft-Cap is not reached, 50% of FYP Tokens will be assigned to Flyp. me and 50%
 to the Contributors.
 If the Soft-Cap is reached but the Hidden-Hard-Cap is not, 40% of FYP Tokens will be
 assigned to Flyp. me and 60% to the Contributors.
 If the Hidden-Hard-Cap is reached, 30% of FYP Tokens will be assigned to Flyp. me and
 70% to the Contributors.
 In order to make Flyp. me more sustainable during its evolution, the FYP Tokens assigned to
 Flyp. me itself and retained by the Company are inversely proportional to the participation to
 the Token sale. In other words, the more contributions to the FYP Tokens sale, the less FYP
 Tokens will be available to Flyp. me. This mechanism and logic, besides making the project
 more stable and sustainable, will further ignite Flyp. me's participatory policy-making model.
 Between 0.3% and 0.7% of FYP Tokens assigned to Flypme will be reserved for bounty
 programs to encourage early adoption, platform engagement and word-of-mouth.The
 percentage of FYP Tokens allocated for bounty programs will vary according to the amount
 of funds raised during the ICO.
 Use of funds
 Funds will be distributed across reserve funds and business funds, in relation to the amount
 raised.
 Please note that the profits generated by those FYP Tokens allocated to Flyp. me will be
 reinvested in the Flyp. me service, its roadmap and to increase fur ther its reserve funds.

 Engineering
 The primary duty of Flyp. me is to ensure the seamless functionality of its service. In order to
 do so, Flyp. me will retain the original team and, according to its needs, further expand its
 engineering operations. This will cover maintenance, new features and proposals to scale,
 expand and further develop the project and its infrastructure and to improve its efficiencies,
 perform code auditing and security reviews.
 High-priority new features include implementing new cryptocurrencies, decentralized asset
 platforms and modules for popular programming languages. Additionally, Flypme will
12
 implement a proposing and voting platform for key decisions and will develop cryptographic
 auditing.
 Flyp.me currently partners with Holy Transaction SA, an R&D company based in Luxemburg
 which created one of the first multi-currency wallets and the oldest still active.
 R&D
 Flyp. me will prioritize R&D in the latest technology improvements with a focus on
 decentralized asset platforms, 2nd layer solutions for cryptocurrency networks to allow
 transactions to be securely routed across multiple peer-to-peer networks, atomic exchanges
 and cryptographic auditing. These improvements will ultimately increase efficiencies and cut
 costs. The development team of Flyp me has a strong commitment to leveraging the latest
 technological advantages of cryptocurrencies and reducing barriers to adoption for people.
 Legal services
 Flyp. me has consulted with law firms which advised the company on the legal framework
 concerning the operations of Flyp. me and its ICo, across different jurisdictions. Flyp me will
 contract specialist law firms in regards to regulatory and licensing frameworks as well as
 other matters.
 Communications and marketing
 Flyp. me collaborates with marketing communicatio professionals both locally and remotely
 to ensure access to the best talent pool with specialist support across a number of
 disciplines and industries.
 Flyp.me will promote the autonomous running of meetups across as many locations as
 possible providing meetup organisers with operational templates and focused themes to be
 adapted depending on geo-specific needs. We believe that building a strong community and
 providing outstanding support will be key to growing and retaining Flyp mes user base as
 well as increasing volumes.
 Business development and strategic partnerships
 Flyp.mes efforts in business development will be focused on growing existing business areas
 aging
 and identifying new opportunities. High growth will be boosted further by leveraging
 strategic partnerships enabled by Flyp. mes permissionless API including:
 E-commerce sites and brick and mortar points of sale that want to accept payments
 in different cryptocurrencies through a plug and play application.
 Crypto startups that want to accept a number of cryptos for their Presale and ICO
 funding
 Multicurrency wallets that want to allow in-wallet crypto-to-crypto exchanges.
 Crypto data aggregators(e.g. ethereumwisdom)and crypto-specific media that want
 to allow accountless crypto-to-crypto exchanges
13
 Roadmap
 Flyp.me will be constantly developed, upgraded and expanded. Code reviews and security
 audits will be continuously done to ensure the highest level of security, efficiency and
 stability.
