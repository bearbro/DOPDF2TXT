Description
GOODWORK is an ecosystem for remote teams. It includes a network of 
coworking spaces, task management system and CRM-system. The project helps 
co-workers to expand the borders and interact with each other f rom any place in 
the world.
The ecosystem is based on GOODWORK coworking spaces. They are going to be 
established in those districts and cities which are chosen by most «ООО» token 
holders. The investors have the right to decide where to open co-working spaces 
to work comfortably.
GOODWORK’s philosophy
We have summarized some points and named them GOODWORK’s philosophy:
1
1
You can’t spend more than 20 minutes to get to work
2
2
You should work in f riendly 
environment
3
3
Your workplace should let 
make you enjoy your work
4
4
Ofﬁce shouldn’t do harm to your 
health
5
5
You should be more productive working f rom ofﬁce and feel more 
comfortable than at home
Each GOODWORK space is established on the basis of the points above. We 
understand that good conditions for employees give excellent results at work.
5
What problem does GOODWORK solve?
Employability of employees regardless of 
geographical location
Possibility to provide comfortable conditions for 
company employees
Transparent storage of information about the 
reputation and experience of employees
Mission
Our goal is to change the global approach of employers to human labor and its 
conditions. The environment at work should be mobile and comfortable, and 
people should not waste their time. Employees should work in good conditions 
to give their employers excellent results.
Nowadays people spend a lot of time on their way to work and back. Many 
companies cannot hire the best specialists, because they are willing to work in 
ofﬁces, which only located close to their home or just f rom home. Many start-
ups cannot afford an ofﬁce with a high-quality inf rastructure, that’s why they 
won’t become corporations. A number of employees have certain requirements 
for ofﬁces: for example, good location and the interior. The major business 
problem is the lack of expensive company ofﬁces for valuable employees in 
those places, whose location is far f rom the main company ofﬁce.
Large corporations have realized long time ago that the main basis of their 
business is people, that’s why they create incredibly convenient conditions for 
their employees. Smaller companies still work “ in the old-fashioned  way”.

Examples of work spaces
Pixar Animation Studios
A football ﬁeld-sized atrium was built in the center of Pixar Animation Studios 
campus. It includes mailboxes, cafeteria and even bathrooms. This atrium is 
designed to give the employees an opportunity of informal communication. At 
the same time Pixar supports the wishes of employees to equip the ofﬁces, cabins, 
desks and working areas on their own f ree choice and to decorate them as they 
wish.
Microsoft
At Microsoft, many employees also have their own personal ofﬁces, but they have 
sliding doors, demountable walls, and there are also other possibilities for their 
inhabitants to decide when they want to work together with their colleagues, and 
when they need to stay alone to reﬂect on a particular task.
7
Google
The Google ofﬁce in New York is quite compact, there is no separate campus for 
its workers, but the company tried to create such a campus in a limited area. 
Actually, the ofﬁce is like a huge cruise liner. There are entertainments and food 
courts everywhere. The building has several dining rooms, cafes and even 
massage rooms.

History and statistics
Co-working spaces ﬁrst appeared in mid - 2000s to meet increased demand of 
workers who are generally called f reelancers.
There are more than 200 million f reelances in the world.
In 5-7 years, the number of 
remote workers will reach 50%
According to the Aberdeen Group report
26%
employees 
work
remotely
According to the Aberdeen 
Group report, about 26% of 
the workforce in the United 
States works remotely on a 
temporary or contract basis, 
their number is growing all 
the time and it is possible 
that in 5-7 years it will reach 
50% . Similar data are given 
by Forbes.
In opposition to the common belief about the insolvency of f reelancers, the 
Freelancers Union research revealed that the average hourly f reelancer rate with 
experience over 5 years is f rom $ 59.15 to $ 84.55, with experience of less than 5 
years - f rom $ 44.87 to $ 49.96. There are the average rates of specialists f rom the 
most popular f reelancer professions below.

According to the Freelance Industry Report 2012, 72% of the f reelancers surveyed 
consider themselves to be entrepreneurs, not wage workers. 40% of respondents 
who participated in this research delegate tasks to other performers and hire 
assistants, occupying a border position between f reelancers and small business 
owners.

Freelancers Union study conﬁrms that f reelancers have entrepreneurial potential, 
more than a third of respondents intend to start their own business, while only 
8.1% want to return to ofﬁce work.
Comparison of average time and productivity in 
different ofﬁces
GOODWORK solves many problems indeed, not only for employees, but also  for 
employers.
Managers of any company are faced with the fact that employees allocate to 
effective work only a small part of their working time. This is due to the fact that 
part of their energy goes to a long road to the ofﬁce, that is why the employee 
starts working day already tired. Uncomfortable working conditions support this 
state throughout the day. Imagine how difﬁcult it is to get together and work 
effectively under such conditions.
When working in GOODWORK spaces, it takes no more than 20 minutes to get to
the ofﬁce, and convenient working spaces allow employees to increase their work 
efﬁciency by 5 times.
